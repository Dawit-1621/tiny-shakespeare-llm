# Tiny Shakespeare LLM project
Tiny Shakespeare is a text corpus (about 1 million characters) compiled from the works of William Shakespeare, including plays like Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, Macbeth, and others. </br>
It was first popularized by Andrej Karpathy in his 2015 project char-rnn, which demonstrated how a simple recurrent neural network (RNN) could learn to generate human-like text character by character.
